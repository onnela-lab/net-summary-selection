"""
Implementation of cost-based feature selection/ranking algorithms.

Implementation of the cost-based version of the filter feature selection method
based on Maximal-Relevance-Minimal-Redundancy (mRMR), Joint Mutual Information
(JMI), Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM), a version of
ReliefF that can compute nearest neighbors either with random forests, or with
an L1 distance. A cost-based ranking is also available by penalization of the
random forest feature importance, or by using the feature importance of
a random forest where the sampling of features at each internal node
is proportional to the inverse of their cost.
Moreover, to analyze the rankings for different penalization parameter values,
we also implement corresponding functions that return the different rankings
for each penalization value.
